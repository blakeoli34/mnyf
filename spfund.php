			<h2>About Stephen Pollock</h2>
			<p>Stephen Pollock is remembered as a dedicated, committed and passionate man. His life is recognized by his strong connection to family and his tremendous loyalty to his mother. Mr. Pollock’s professional contributions included his service to the Department of Human Services (formerly known as the Department of Social Services and the Family Independence Agency) with service from 1967 through 1992. Mr. Pollock continued his service as the Executive Director of the Michigan Coalition Against Homelessness from 1992 through 1994. During this time, Mr. Pollock was a strong influence in support of the Michigan Network for Youth and Families on a part-time basis and was hired as the full-time Executive Director for MNYF in 1995. Mr. Pollock’s leadership of MNYF was a significant factor in expanding membership, training and technical assistance support to runaway and homeless providers throughout the State of Michigan. Pollock also developed a strong relationship with legislators, helping to secure a voice for homeless, runaway, and at-risk youth and their families throughout Michigan.</p>

			<p>In 2003, Mr. Pollock died, losing his fight against cancer. The Pollock family, MNYF, and the State of Michigan lost a man of significant character and dedicated to the contribution for the well-being of others.</p>

			<p>In honor of Mr. Pollock, MNYF established the Stephen Pollock Memorial Fund. The Pollock family, led by his mother, Charlene, made the first initial contribution. The fund is intended to provide opportunity to youth in civic engagement and leadership.</p>

			<h2>Dome Day</h2>
			<p>In accordance with the fund's mission to engage youth in civic leadership, several youth have been awarded scholarships to attend the annual Dome Day, which is an annual event hosted by the Michigan Network for Youth and Families. Michigan youth visit the state capitol and schedule meetings with elected officials to discuss programming and their personal experiences. Over 22 youth-focused agencies and hundreds of teens meet with State Representatives on March 15th.</p>

			<p>“This is a great opportunity for youth who might not otherwise have contact with elected officials to actually talk about their life experiences. It is also a time for our state representatives to have personal conversations with youth who were homeless and to learn how teens end up on the streets or living in shelters, with family or friends,” commented Heather Wiegand, Board Chair for the Michigan Network for Youth and Families.</p>
